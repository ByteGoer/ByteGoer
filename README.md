ðŸŒ± **CS Student & Passion Projects**  
Hey, Iâ€™m **Ezrah**! Iâ€™m learning game development and exploring PFAS research in my free time. Most people know me for my art, but I decided to study something new in college!

## âœ¿ Artist & Animator  
When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m designing characters, creating background art, or animating.  
Iâ€™ve recently shifted from comics toward animation and game projects now that my series is finished. Just focusing on passion projects!

## âœ¿ Currently Working On:
- New artsy website! Social media is limiting my need to customize every part of my profile!
- Portfolio site! 
- Learning Git, source control, web dev, and databases.
- Creating some casual peaceful games to help productivity, shifting to 3D horror soon!
- 3D models... I miss ZBrush.

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- PFAS or any forever chemicals! I'm always happy to learn about others interests and discuss them together :D
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: (WIP - working on sites to make this easier)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I chose to major in cs because I didn't want to study art. It's awesome!!
